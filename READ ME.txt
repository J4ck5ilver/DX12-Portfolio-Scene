This is a school assignment made by three student with the focus on learning DirectX 12 for a 3D course at BTH.

Techniques:
	Instancing
	Skybox
	Light Culling
	Deferred Rendering
	Normal Mapping
	No use of the IA (Input Assembler), meshes are uploaded to a SRV resource instead.


Things that can be improved:
	General code architecture in the renderer class (For example seperate the render class into more minor classes for a easier architectural overview).
	Scene update (Front end - Update of light cubes).
	Better thread utilization.
	Light culling. (There can be some light flicker in the scene due to this as well some visual light artifacts).
